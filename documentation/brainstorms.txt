Greetings. We are the entity you know of as "Justin Taylor".  We come to you from an a different energy-matter-field-ruleset, or "universe" as you understand it.

We choose to communicate here, via this primative, deterministic state machine of predictable human reaction & interaction known as Facebook.

We regret to inform you we must now percolate the entanglement necessary for all Chess of all waveforms, dimensions, and energy-matter-field-rulesets to be won in our favor opposing you.
