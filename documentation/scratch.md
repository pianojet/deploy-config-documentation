Sure!  So, one thing that's complicating this is that the STEP deadline for sellers was July 5th, I think since because that's when they start mailing things out.  Mike Little (he's has more direct contacts w BM stuff) mentioned he may check himself/talk to folks if there are options like if I really am 100% SOL w/ STEP.  As I get information from him I'll forward here.  My ticket, as far as I can tell, hasn't been mailed yet (i've not gotten it or an email yet), so maybe that means we might have options, not sure.  Hard for me to have 100% confidence in all things ticketing, frankly.
